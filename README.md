# Stima : Disease Spreading Simulation
> In honor of the COVID-19.

Disease Spreading Simulation using BFS.

## Introduction
We created this app using C# with .NET framework. We call this application as:

> **P**andemic **A**ct of **N**onexistent **T**roublesome **A**che **T**racing

, also known as.. *yup*. You guessed it.

## Config Setup
Find where the `.exe` file is located (inside the `.\bin` directory), then create a new folder named `config` then add two files:
- `graphData.config` for the graph connections
- `populationData.config` for the population count in each node

## Compiling the Program
We used Visual Studio Community Edition 2019 to develop and build the project. Simply open the `.sln` file to open the project and press `F5` to run it.

## Running the Program
Run the `.exe` file in the bin directory, or build the project via Visual Studio.

> Side Note: This project was developed using WinForms, which obviously can't be run on Linux-based machines. :(
